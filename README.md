## Factory reset explained

The factory reset feature allows you to reset your Satochip or Seedkeeper card to its factory state. 
This means that all private keys, saved information and settings (such as PIN code or label) will be deleted from the device.

Before starting the reset process, make sure you have a backup of the contents; either the seedphrase (from your Satochip hardware wallet) or any other password stored in your card.

The reset process is simple: plug in your card, launch the Satochip-Utils tool, click on "Reset my card", read the text and click on "Start".
Then follow the pop-up wizard and remove your card from the smart card reader, then insert it again. And do this several times.
